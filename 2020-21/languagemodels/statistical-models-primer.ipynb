A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'\", \"About being a cowgirl. What's it all about?

Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...', \"But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?\", \"Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.\", 'But Countess...', 'Purely personal.

What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite.

They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking.

They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place.

And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.', 'But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.', 'Nice to finally meet you, sir.', 'This is Colonel Richards.', 'Good work.  Really.', \"That'll be all, boys.\", 'Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.', 'Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?', 'Easy now.', \"So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?\", \"Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!\", \"Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?\", 'The first.', '\"Emperor Miguelito...?\"', \"I've even printed my own currency.\", 'Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!', 'That would be... the Mexican War?', 'These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.', \"Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!\", 'The U.S. is my jurisdiction.', \"Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?\", 'Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!', \"You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.\", 'Philistine.', 'He had a pressing engagement.', \"Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.\", \"Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.\", \"You're not that big.\", 'Dr. Loveless?', \"... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!\", 'Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?', \"Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.\", 'How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?', 'Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.', 'I deal with some tough customers.', 'Really?  Must be a dangerous business.', 'No, sir... just a businessman.', 'Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.', 'Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.', 'I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.', \"When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?\", 'I admire a man with a sense of humor.', \"You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.\", 'I beg your pardon?', 'It is?', \"Now it's a bomb.\", \"It's a smelting retort.\", 'This is something.', \"He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.\", \"He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?\", \"For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.\", 'Are you all right?', \"A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.\", \"A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.\", 'Who was this partner of his?', 'I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the \"rare and unparalleled opportunity\" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It\\'s sad.  So few men do.', \"We'll explain on the way.\", 'Who were they?  What do they want with me?', 'Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.', 'Yes!', 'Dr. Pemberton?', 'Right.', \"Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...\", \"You're not going to use it, are you?\", 'Hey...!', \"In an hour they're gone!\", \"They're rounding up a posse.
